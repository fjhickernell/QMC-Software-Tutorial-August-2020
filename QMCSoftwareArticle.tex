\section{Introduction}
Quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods promise great efficiency gains over independent and identically distributed (IID) Monte Carlo (MC) methods.  In some cases QMC may achieve one hundredth of the error as IID MC in the same amount of time. Often, these efficiency gains are obtained simply by  replacing IID sampling by the low discrepancy (LD) sampling that is at the heart of QMC. 

If you are a practitioner, you would like to test whether QMC would speed your computation.  You would like easy access to the best QMC algorithms available.  If you are a theoretician or algorithm developer, you would like try out your best ideas on a variety of use cases to demonstrate their practical value.  

This tutorial points to some of the best QMC software available.  Moreover, we describe QMCPy \cite{QMCPy2020a}, which is designed to become a community owned Python library that combines the best QMC algorithms under a common user interface.  A demonstration of how QMCPy works is given in a Google Colab notebook \cite{QMCPyTutColab2020}.

The model problem for QMC is to approximate an integral,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:integral}
	\mu := \int_\calT g(\bst) \, \lambda(\bst) \, \D \bst,
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the integrand, and $\lambda$ is a non-negative weight.  We use $\mu$ to denote the value of this integral because we perform a transformation to interpret it as the population mean of a random variable, 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:fintegral}
	\mu = \bbE[f(\bsX)] = \int_\calX f(\bsx) \, \varrho(\bsx) \, \D \bsx =  \int_\calX f(\bsx) \,  \D F(\bsx) ,
\end{equation}
where $\varrho$ is a probability density with corresponding probability distribution $F$. 
A good choice of $f$ can make computation more efficient.

QMC approximates this population mean by a sample mean,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:samplemean}
	\hmu := \frac 1n \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(\bsX_i), \qquad \bsX_0, \bsX_1, \ldots \sim F.
\end{equation}
The choice of this sequence, and the choice of $n$ to satisfy  the prescribed error tolerance are important decisions.  QMC software helps the user make those decisions.

Here, the notation ``$\sim$'' means that the sequence mimics the specified, target distribution, but not necessarily in a probabilistic way.  We  use this notation in two forms:  $\IIDsim$ and $\LDsim$.

IID points are random. The position of each point is not influenced by the other, so clusters and gaps occur.  A subset of IID points chosen randomly is also IID.  When we say that $\bsX_0, \bsX_1, \ldots \IIDsim F$, we mean that for any positive integer $n$, the  multivariate probability distribution of $\bsX_0, \ldots, \bsX_{n-1}$ is the product of the marginals, specifically,
\begin{equation*}
	F_{n}(\bsx_0, \ldots, \bsx_{n-1}) = F(\bsx_0) \cdots  F(\bsx_{n-1}).
\end{equation*}
When IID points are used to approximate $\mu$ by the sample mean, the error is $\calO(n^{-1/2})$.  Figure \ref{fig:comparePts} displays IID uniform points, $\bsX^{\IID}_0, \bsX^{\IID}_1, \ldots \IIDsim \calU[0,1]^2$, where the target distribution is $F(\bsx) = x_1 x_2$


\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{ags/figs/dd_iid_uniform_pts.png}
	\qquad
	\includegraphics[height=5cm]{ags/figs/dd_sobol_pts.png}
	\caption{IID points contrasted with LD points.  The LD points cover the square more evenly.}
	\label{fig:comparePts}
\end{figure}

LD points may be deterministic or random, but each point is carefully coordinated with the other so that they fill the square well.  When we say that $\bsX_0, \bsX_1, \ldots \LDsim F$, we mean that for any positive integer $n$,  the empirical distribution of $\bsX_0, \ldots, \bsX_{n-1}$, denoted $F_{\{\bsX_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}}$,  approximate the target distribution, $F$, well (relative to $n$).  (The empirical distribution of a set assigns equal probability to each point.)  The measure of the difference between the empirical distribution of a set of points and the target distribution is called a \emph{discrepancy} and is denoted $D(\{\bsX_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}, F)$.  This is the origin of the term low discrepancy points.  LD points by definition have a smaller discrepancy than IID points.  Figure \ref{fig:comparePts} contrasts IID uniform points with LD points, $\bsX^{\LD}_0, \bsX^{\LD}_1 \ldots \LDsim \calU[0,1]^2$, in this case linearly scrambled Sobol' points. For most LD sequences, the target distribution is $\calU[0,1]^d$.

The error of the sample mean in approximating the integral can be bounded according to the Koksma-Hlawka and its extensions as the product of the discrepancy of the sampling sequence and the variation of the integrand, denoted $V(\cdot)$:
\begin{equation}
	\QMCPYabs{\mu - \hmu} = \QMCPYabs{\int_{\calX} f(\bsx) \, \D (F - F_{\{\bsX_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}}) (\bsx)} \le D(\{\bsX_i\}_{i=0}^{n-1}, F) V(f),
\end{equation} 
The variation is a (semi-) norm of the integrand in a suitable Banach space.  The discrepancy corresponds to the norm of the error functional for that Banach space.  For typical Banach spaces, the discrepancy of LD points is $\calO(n^{-1+\epsilon})$, which is a higher convergence order than for IID points.  For details, the reader is referred to the references.  For our purposes, we hope  that the reader sees here in Figure \ref{fig:comparePts} that the LD points cover the integration domain more evenly than IID points and that in the examples below the reader will see the demonstrably smaller cubature errors.

In the sections that follow we first overview available QMC software.  We next describe an architecture for good QMC software, i.e., what are the key components and how should they interact.  We then describe how we have implemented this architecture in QMCPy.  Finally, we summarize further directions that we hope QMCPy and related software projects will take.  Those interested in following the development of QMCPy or even contributing to its growth are urged to visit the GitHub repository at \href{https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/}{\nolinkurl{https://qmcsoftware.github.io/QMCSoftware/}}.

\section{Available Software for QMC} \label{sec:available} 
QMC software spans three categories:  LD sequence generators, algorithms, and applications.  We review the better known software collections, recognizing that some software overlaps multiple categories.

\end{description}

The sections that follow describe QMCPy \cite{QMCPy2020a}, which is our attempt to combine the best of the above software under a common user interface written in Python 3.  The choice of language was determined by the desire to make QMC software accessible to a broad audience, especially the tech industry.


\section{Components of QMC Software}
QMC cubature can be summarized as follows.  We want to approximate $\mu$ well by $\hmu$, where \eqref{eq:integral}, \eqref{eq:fintegral}, and \eqref{eq:samplemean} combine to give
\begin{multline} \label{eq:cubSummary}
	\mu : = \int_\calT g(\bst) \, \lambda(\bst) \, \D \bst  = \bbE[f(\bsX)] = \int_\calX f(\bsx) \, \varrho(\bsx) \, \D \bsx \approx \frac 1n \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} f(\bsX_i) =: \hmu, \\
	 \bsX_0, \bsX_1, \ldots \sim F.
\end{multline}
This required four components, which we implement in QMCPy as classes.

\begin{description}[format=\textup,format=\textbf]
	
	\item[Discrete Distribution] that produces $\bsX_0, \bsX_1, \dots$ mimicking the distribution $F$, which typically is $\calU[0,1]^d$;
	
	\item[True Measure] $\bst \mapsto \lambda (\bst) \D \bst$ that defines the original integral, e.g., Gaussian or Lebesgue;
	
	\item[Integrand] $g$ that  defines the original integral, plus the transformed version, $f$, to fit the discrete distribution; and
	
	\item[Stopping Criterion] that determines how large $n$ should be to ensure that $\QMCPYabs{\mu - \hmu_n} \le \varepsilon$.
\end{description}

The software libraries referenced in Section \ref{sec:available} provide one or more of these components.  QMCPy combines multiple examples of them all under and object oriented framework. Each example is implemented as a concrete class that realizes the properties and methods required by the abstract class for that component. The following sections detail descriptions and use cases each component and select implementations. Thorough documentation of all QMCPy classes can be found in \cite{QMCPyDocs}. 

QMCPy may be installed from PyPI via the command \texttt{pip install qmcpy}. In the sections that follow we assume qmcpy as been imported via the following python command: 
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/import.py}
The figures in this paper can be reproduced in the Google Colab notebook \AGSComment{CITE, put this earlier?}.

\section{Discrete Distributions}

LD sequences typically mimic $\calU[0,1]^d$, which we assume here.  Good sequences for other distributions are obtained by transformations in the next section.  

QMCPy implements \emph{extensible} LD sequences, i.e., those that allow practitioners to obtain and use additional $f(\bsX_i)$ without discarding the existing $f(\bsX_i)$.  Halton sequences do not have preferred sample sizes $n$, but integration lattices and digital sequences do.  These latter two also have an elegant group structure, which we summarize in Table \ref{tab:GroupProp}.  For simplicity we restrict ourselves to the case where the first $2^m$ points of these LD sequences form a group under the addition operator $\oplus$.

We illustrate lattice and Sobol' sequences using QMCPy. First, we create an instance of a $d=2$ dimensional \texttt{Lattice} object of the  \texttt{DiscreteDistribution} abstract class.  Then we generate the first eight (non-randomized) points in this lattice:
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/dd_lattice.py}
The first three generators for this lattice are $\bsZ_1 = (0.5, 0.5)$, $\bsZ_2 = (0.25, 0.75)$, and $\bsZ_4 = (0.125, 0.875)$.  One can check that $(\bsZ_2 + \bsZ_4) \bmod \bsone = (0.375, 0.625) = \bsZ_6$, as Table \ref{tab:GroupProp} specifies.

The randomized shift has been turned off above to illuminate the group structure.  In practice, we normally include the randomization to ensure that there are no points on the boundary of $[0,1]^d$.  Then, when points are transformed to mimic distributions such as the Gaussian, no LD points will be transformed to infinity.  Turning off the randomization generates a warning to the user.

Now, we generate Sobol' points using a similar process as we did for lattice points.  Sobol' sequences are one of the most popular example of digital sequences.
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/dd_sobol.py}
Here, $\bsZ_4$ differs from that for lattices, but more importantly, addition for digital sequences differs from that for lattices.  Using digitwise addition for digital sequences, we can confirm that according to Table \ref{tab:GroupProp},
\begin{multline*}
\bsZ_2 \oplus_{\dig} \bsZ_4 = (0.25,0.75)  \oplus_{\dig} (0.125,0.625) \\
=  ({}_20.010,{}_20.110)  \oplus_{\dig} ({}_20.001,{}_20.101) = ({}_20.011,{}_20.011) \\
= (0.375,0.375) = \bsZ_6.
\end{multline*}

By contrast, if we construct a digital sequence using the generators for the lattice above with $\bsZ_2 = (0.25, 0.75)$, and $\bsZ_4 = (0.125, 0.875)$, we would obtain
\begin{multline*}
\bsZ_6 = \bsZ_2 \oplus_{\dig} \bsZ_4   = ({}_20.010,{}_20.110)  \oplus_{\dig} ({}_20.001,{}_20.111)  \\
= ({}_20.011,{}_20.001) = (0.375, 0.125),
\end{multline*}
which differs from the $\bsZ_6=(0.375, 0.625)$ constructed for lattices.  To emphasize, lattices and digital sequences are different, even if they share the same generators, $\bsZ_1, \bsZ_2, \bsZ_4, \ldots$.

The examples of \texttt{qp.Lattice} and \texttt{qp.Sobol} illustrate how QMCPy LD generators share a common user interface.  The dimension is specified when the instance is constructed, and the number of points is specified when the \texttt{gen\_samples} method is called.  Following Python practice, parameters can be input without specifying their names if they are input in the prescribed order.  QMCPy also includes Halton sequences and IID sequences, again deferring details to the QMCPy documentation \cite{QMCPyDocs}.

A crucial difference between IID generators and LD generators is reflected in the behavior in generating $n$ points.  For an IID generator, asking for $n$ points repeatedly gives you different points each time because they are meant to be random and independent.
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/dd_iidone.py}
Your output may look different depending on the seed used to generate these random numbers.

On the other hand for an LD generator, asking for $n$ points repeatedly gives you \emph{the same} points each time because they are meant to be the first $n$ points of a given LD sequence.  
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/dd_latticeone.py}
Here we allow the randomization so that the first point in the sequence is not the origin.  To obtain the \emph{next} $n$ points one may specify the start and ending indices of the sequence.
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/dd_latticenextone.py}

\AGSComment{can remove \texttt{print}s as return values will automatically be printed to console after each command.}

Figure \ref{fig:increase_n} shows how increasing the number of lattice and Sobol' LD points through powers of two fills in the gaps in an even way.

\FJHComment{Need a figure here with plots of lattice and Sobol' wit $n = 16$, $32$ and $64$ in different colors all on one plot. }
\AGSComment{I think 64, 128, 256 looks nicer, but I can change to 16, 32, 64 if we want.}

\end{figure}

\section{True Measures}

The LD sequences implemented as \text{DiscreteDistribution} objects typically mimic the $\calU[0,1]^d$ distribution.  However, we may need sequences to mimic other distributions.  This can be implemented via variable transformations, $\bsPsi$.  In general, if $\bsX \sim \calU[0,1]^d$, then
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:exampleVarTrans}
\begin{gather}
\bsT = \bsPsi(\bsX) := (\bsb - \bsa) \odot \bsX + \bsa \sim  \calU[\bsa,\bsb], \\
\label{eq:exampleVarTransGauss}
\bsT = \bsPsi(\bsX) := \mA^T \bsPhi^{-1}(\bsX) + \bsa \sim \calN(\bsa, \mSigma), \\
\nonumber  \text{where }  \bsPhi^{-1}(\bsX) : = \begin{pmatrix} \Phi^{-1}(X_1) \\ \vdots \\ \Phi^{-1}(X_d)\end{pmatrix}, \qquad \mSigma = \mA \mA^T,
\end{gather}
\end{subequations}
and $\odot$ denotes term-by-term (Hadamard) multiplication.  Here, $\bsa$ and $\bsb$ are assumed to be finite, and $\Phi$ is the standard Gaussian distribution function.  Again we use ``$\sim$'' to denote mimicry, not necessarily in a probabilistic sense.

Figure \ref{fig:tm_ug} displays LD sequences transformed as described above to mimic a uniform and a Gaussian distribution.  The code to generate these points takes the following form of 
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/tm_uniform.py}
for uniform points based on a Halton sequence, and 
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/tm_gaussian.py}
for Gaussian points based on a lattice sequence. \AGSComment{Add ... to code when using multi-line commands.}

	\label{fig:tm_ug}
\end{figure}

The Brownian motion distribution arises often in financial risk applications.  Here the $d$ components of the variable $\bsT$ correspond to the Brownian motion at times $\tau/d, 2\tau/d, \ldots, \tau$, where $\tau$ is the time horizon.  The distribution is a special case of the Gaussian with covariance $\mSigma = (\tau/d) \bigl (\min(j,k) \bigr)_{j,k=1}^d$ and mean $\bsa$, which  correspond to a drift coefficient times $(\tau/d)(1, 2, \ldots, d)^T$.  \AGSComment{... and mean 0.

The true measure defines the transform required for $F$ to mimic $\lambda$. This change of variables allows us to transform the original integrand $g$ to the a integrand $f$ which accepts samples generated from the discrete distribution. QMCPy performs the necessary transformations automatically during construction of the integrand object. The following examples assume a discrete distribution mimicking $\calU[0,1]^d$. 

Suppose our true measure is defined as $\calU[\bsa,\bsb]$ where $\bsa,\bsb$ are finite $d$-dimensional vectors of lower and upper bounds respectively. Then we may generate samples mimicking this non-standard Uniform distribution using the \texttt{gen\_samples} function $T(\bsx) = (\bsb-\bsa)\bsx + \bsa$. The resulting transformed integrand may be written as $f(\bsx) = g(T(\bsx))$. The following code utilizes QMCPy to construct a non-standard uniform object and draw samples with the \texttt{gen\_samples} method for true measures.  Note that each true measure is constructed with a discrete distribution and that that not all true measures implement a \texttt{gen\_samples} method. For example, it is not reasonable to generate samples that mimic the Lebesgue measure. Figure \ref{fig:tm_ug} shows samples generated from a non-standard Uniform measure. 



Now, suppose our true measure is a Gaussian $\calN(\mu,\Sigma)$ where the covariance $\Sigma$ may be decomposed as $\Sigma=AA^T$ using methods such as principal component analysis or the Cholesky decomposition. (Note that $\mu$ here is different than the previously defined true mean.) Then the \texttt{gen\_samples} function, $T(\bsx) = A^T \Phi^{-1}(\bsx) + \mu$ where $\Phi$ is the CDF function for the standard Gaussian, is utilized to develop the transformed integrand $f(\bsx) = g(T(\bsx))$. The following code uses QMCPy's Gaussian object to generate samples from a lattice discrete distribution and transform them to mimic a non-standard Gaussian. Figure \ref{fig:tm_ug} shows samples generated from a non-standard Gaussian measure.   

\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/tm_gaussian.py}


Finally, we discuss Geometric Brownian Motion using QMCPy. With monitoring times $\bst = (j/d)_{j=1}^d$, Brownian Motion is equivalent to the Gaussian true measure $\calN(0,\Sigma)$ where $\Sigma = (\min(t_j,t_k))_{j,k=1}^d$. QMCPy also allows the user to perform importance sampling with a $\calN(\bsa,\Sigma)$ measure where scalar $a$ is a drift parameter appropriately extended to a $d \times 1$ mean vector in the importance sampling measure. Intuitively, importance sampling samples rare events more frequently but with less weight, leading to faster convergence. Specifically, we define the \texttt{gen\_samples} function as $T(\bsx) = A^T\Phi^{-1}(\bsx) + \bsa$ and then the resulting transformed function as $f(\bsx) = g(T(\bsx))\exp((\bsa/2-\bsx)^T\Sigma^{-1}\bsa)$. Note that if we choose not to use importance sampling, $a=0$, then the transformed function collapses to the familiar $f(\bsx) = g(T(\bsx))$. The following example uses the Brownian Motion object from QMCPy to generate samples with an upward drift of $a=2$ based on the underlying Sobol' sequence. Figure \ref{fig:tm_bm} shows samples generated from a discrete Brownian Motion with and without importance sampling.

\section{Integrands}

Let's return now to the integration problem in \eqref{eq:integral}, which we must rewrite as \eqref{eq:fintegral}.  We choose a transformation of variables defined as $\bst = \bsPsi(\bsx)$ where $\bsPsi:\calX \to \calT$.  This leads to 
\begin{align}
	\nonumber 
 \mu &= \int_\calT g(\bst) \, \lambda(\bst) \, \D \bst  = \int_\calX g\bigl(\bsPsi(\bsx)\bigr) \, \lambda\bigl(\bsPsi(\bsx)\bigr) \,\QMCPYabs{\frac{\partial \bsPsi}{\partial \bsx}} \, \D \bsx =  \int_\calX f(\bsx) \, \varrho(\bsx) \, \D \bsx  \\
 \label{eq:transVar}
  & \qquad \qquad \text{where } f(\bsx)  = g\bigl(\bsPsi(\bsx)\bigr)  \, \frac{\lambda(\bsPsi(\bsx))}{\varrho(\bsx)} \,\QMCPYabs{\frac{\partial \bsPsi}{\partial \bsx}},
\end{align}
and $\QMCPYabs{\partial \bsPsi/\partial \bsx}$ represents the Jacobian of the variable transformation.  The abstract class \texttt{Integrand} provides $f$ based on the user's input of $g$ and the \texttt{TrueMeasure} instance, which defines $\lambda$ and the transformation $\bsPsi$.  Different choices of $\bsPsi$ lead to different $f$, which may give different rates of convergence of the cubature, $\hmu$ to $\mu$.  

We illustrate the use of the \texttt{Integrand} class via an example of Keister \cite{Kei96}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:KeisterIntegral}
	\mu 
	= \int_{\bbR^d} \cos(\lVert \bst \rVert) \exp(-\bst^T \bst) \, \D \bst \\ 
	= \int_{\bbR^d} \underbrace{\pi^{d/2} \cos(\lVert \bst \rVert)}_{g(\bst)}\, \underbrace{\pi^{-d/2} \exp(-\bst^T \bst) }_{\lambda(\bst)} \, \D \bst.
\end{equation}
We will use QMC methods to approximate this integral, which means that it will be transformed according to \eqref{eq:transVar} for the case where $\calX = [0,1]^d$ and $\varrho(\bsx) = 1$.  Since $\lambda$ is the density for $\calN(0,\mI/2)$, it is natural to choose $\bsPsi$ according to \eqref{eq:exampleVarTransGauss} with $\mA = \sqrt{1/2} \, \mI$, in which case $\lambda(\bsPsi(\bsx)) \QMCPYabs{\partial \bsPsi/\partial \bsx} / \varrho(\bsx) = 1$, and so 
\[
\mu = \int_{[0,1]^d} \underbrace{\pi^{d/2} \cos(\lVert \bsPsi(\bsx) \rVert)}_{f(\bsx)} \, \D \bsx, \qquad 
\bsPsi(\bsx) := \sqrt{1/2}\bigl(\Phi^{-1}(x_1),  \ldots, \Phi^{-1}(x_d)\bigr)^T .
\]

The code below sets up an \texttt{Integrand} instance using QMCPy's \texttt{CustomFun} wrapper to tie a user-defined function $g$ into the QMCPy framework.  Then we evaluate the sample mean of $n=1000$ $f$ values obtained by sampling at transformed Halton points.
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/i_keister.py}
For Halton sequences the preferred $n$ values are rather sparse, so we typically do not try to limit $n$ to those values as we do for lattices and Sobol' sequences.  We have no indication yet of how accurate our approximation is.  This aspect of QMCPy is described in the next section.  Figure \ref{fig:ikc} visualizes sampling on the original integrand, $g$, and sampling on the transformed integrand, $f$. 

\begin{figure}
	\includegraphics[height=6cm]{ags/figs/i_keister_contours.png}
	\caption{Left: Sampling the original integrand $g$ according to $\calN(0,\mI/2)$.  Right: Sampling the transformed integrand $f$ according to $\calU[0,1]^2$.  Halton points are used in both cases.}
	\label{fig:ikc}
\end{figure}

Another way to approximate the Keister integral in \eqref{eq:KeisterIntegral} is to write it as an integral with respect to the Lebesgue measure:
\begin{align*} 
	\mu 
	& = \int_{\bbR^d} \underbrace{\cos(\lVert \bst \rVert) \exp(-\bst^T \bst) }_{g(\bst)} \, \underbrace{1}_{\lambda(\bst)} \,\D \bst \\
	& = \int_{[0,1]^d} \underbrace{\cos(\lVert \bsPsi(\bsx) \rVert) \exp(-\bsPsi^T\!\!(\bsx) \bsPsi(\bsx)) \QMCPYabs{\frac{\partial \bsPsi}{\partial \bsx}} }_{f(\bsx)} \, \D \bsx,
\end{align*}
where $\bsPsi$ is any transformation from $\bbR^d$ to $[0,1]^d$.  QMCPy can perform the cubature this way as well.
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/i_keisterLebesgue.py}
The $\bsPsi$ chosen when transforming uniform points on the unit cube to fill the $\bbR^d$ is the one given by \eqref{eq:exampleVarTransGauss} with $\mA = \mI$.

In the examples above, one needed to input the correct $g$ into \texttt{CustomFun} along with the correct \texttt{TrueMeasure} $\lambda$ to define the integration problem.  The \texttt{Keister} integrand instance  included in the QMCPy library takes a more flexible approach of defining the integration problem $\mu$ in \eqref{eq:KeisterIntegral}.  Choosing different true measures leave $\mu$ unchanged but  correspond to different choices of $\bsPsi$.  
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/built-in_Keister.py}
This is essentially to \emph{importance sampling}.


\AGSComment{The Keister function now works with either $\calN(0,1/2)$ or the Lebesgue measure (see \texttt{integrand/code/keister} in our Colab notebook). \FJHComment{But only seems to work for these two.} Our Asian Option (not Mike Gile's multi-level) will only work with a Brownian Motion true measure, but will perform importance sampling automatically if drift $\neq 0$. Also, Brownian Motion now supports exercise time $\neq 1$ (see \texttt{true measure/figs/brownian motion} in our Colab notebook.} \FJHComment{Thanks for generalizing.  Sometimes you may want to add not just a drift but importance sample with a different variance for your Brownian motion.}

\FJHComment{Given $g$ and $\lambda$ to define your integral, suppose that $\lambda(\bst)$ is some multiple of some multivariate normal distribution:

Suppose that we use the variable transformation $\bsPsi$ defined in \eqref{eq:exampleVarTransGauss}.  By what you have derived above:
\begin{align*}
	\QMCPYabs{\frac{\partial \bsPsi}{\partial \bsx}} 
	& = \frac{\det(\mA^T)}{\prod_{j=1}^d \phi(\Phi^{-1}(x_j))} = \sqrt{(2\pi)^d \det(\mSigma)} \exp\bigl( \QMCPYnormnorm[2]{\bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx)}^2/2\bigr) \\

	& \qquad \qquad -   (\mA^T\bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx) +\bsa -\bsb)^T\mLambda^{-1}(\mA^T\bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx) +\bsa -\bsb)        ] /2   \bigr) \\
	& =  c \sqrt{\frac{\det(\mSigma)}{\det(\mLambda)}} \exp \bigl( [ \bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx)^T \bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx)

\end{align*}
If $\mLambda = \mSigma$, then this simplifies to
\begin{equation*}
		\lambda\bigl(\bsPsi(\bsx)\bigr) \QMCPYabs{\frac{\partial \bsPsi}{\partial \bsx}}
	 =  c \exp \bigl( - (\bsa -\bsb)^T \mLambda^{-1} [

\begin{align*}
	\lambda\bigl(\bsPsi(\bsx)\bigr) \QMCPYabs{\frac{\partial \bsPsi}{\partial \bsx}}
	& = \frac{c\sigma}{\lambda} 
	\exp \bigl( [ (\lambda^2 -\sigma^2)\bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx)^T\bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx) 
	\\
	& -  (\bsa -\bsb)^T [
	2\sigma \bsPhi^{-1}(\bsx) + (\bsa -\bsb)] /(2\lambda^2)   \bigr) .
\end{align*}

\section{Stopping Criteria}

The stopping criteria determines the number of samples $n$ that are required for the sample mean approximation $\hat{\mu}$ to be within error tolerance $\varepsilon$ of the true mean $\mu$. 

The following example shows how to run a QMC simulation that approximates the Keister function to within absolute tolerance $\varepsilon_{\text{abs}}=10^{-3}$ using QMCPy. Note the nested construction where the discrete distribution is passed into the true measure which is passed into the integrand which is passed into the stopping criterion. This architecture allows QMCPy to perform the change of variables transformation behind the scenes. The nested construction also provides the stopping criterion knowledge of the other three components, thus allowing the \texttt{integrate} method to perform the QMC simulation. Finally, note that the data object returned by the \texttt{integrate} method can be nicely printed to show parameters set during the simulation. Individual QMCPy objects may also be printed to reveal underlying parameters. 
\lstinputlisting[style=Python]{ags/python/sc_keister_qmc.py}

Figure \ref{fig:sc_comp} compares MC and QMC stopping criterion on the Keister integrand. We see that QMC methods requires significantly fewer samples that MC methods to achieve the same error tolerance. This empirical behaviour matches the theoretical cost of the QMC/MC methods.

\section{Under the Hood}

\subsection{Option Pricing Example}
Next, we focus our attention on option pricing. While QMCPy has a number of single and multi-level options available, we now focus solely on the Asian call option. Roughly, the  Asian call option computes the average overshot of the strike price. Specifically, if $\bsx$ is a length $d$ discrete Brownian Motion sample and $\bst = (j/d)_{j=1}^d$ are the discrete monitoring times of the option, one may approximate the the option price at the $j^{th}$ monitoring time as 
$$S(t_j,x_j) = S_0 \exp((r-\sigma^2/2)t+\sigma x_j).$$
Here $S_0$ is the start price, $\sigma$ is the volatility, and $r$ is the interest rate. Now, if we define $K$ as the strike price, the arithmetic Asian call option may be written as 
$$g(\bsx) = \max\left(\frac{1}{2d}\sum_{j=1}^d [S(t_{j-1},x_{j-1})+S(t_j,x_j)]-K,0\right).$$
Figure \ref{fig:aco} shows drifted Brownian motion paths and their corresponding option pricing paths. The following code utilizes QMCPy's Asian option object to make a crude approximation of the payoff. The following section will describe stopping criterion useful to automatically determining $n$.
