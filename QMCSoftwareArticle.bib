publisher = {Winter Simulation Conference},
abstract = {Monte Carlo simulation applies to a wide range of estimation problems, but converges
rather slowly in general. Variance reduction techniques can lower the estimation error,
sometimes by a large factor, but rarely change the convergence rate of the estimation
error. This error usually decreases as the inverse square root of the computational
effort, as dictated by the central limit theorem. In theory, there exist simulation
estimators with zero variance, i.e., that always provide the exact value. The catch
is that these estimators are usually much too difficult (or virtually impossible)
to implement. However, there are situations, especially in the context of rare-event
simulation, where the zero-variance simulation can be approximated well enough to
provide huge efficiency gains. Adaptive versions can even yield a faster convergence
rate, including exponential convergence in some cases. This paper gives a brief overview
of these methods and discuss their practicality.},
